###  Key Features Implemented
- **Complete API Client**: Implemented full client with all endpoints, error handling, and retry logic
- **Production-Ready Structure**: Multi-stage Docker build, proper logging, configuration management
- **Basic Dashboard Functionality**: Working overview metrics, event tables, filtering, auto-refresh
- **Test Framework**: Unit tests for API client with mocking and error scenarios

###  Dashboard Features Working

-  Real-time overview metrics (total events, avg sentiment, sentiment distribution)
-  Recent events table with filtering
-  Date range, source, and sentiment filtering
-  Auto-refresh with configurable intervals
-  Responsive layout with sidebar controls

## API Endpoints to Leverage

###  Available Endpoints (sentiment_analyzer/api) - IMPLEMENTED

  - Filtering: start_time, end_time, source, source_id, sentiment_label 
  - Pagination: cursor-based with limit parameter 
  - Returns: SentimentResultDTO objects 
  
- **`GET /metrics`**: Aggregated metrics for dashboard summaries 
  - Filtering: start_time, end_time, source, source_id, sentiment_label

## Notes

###  Development Notes - PHASE 1 COMPLETE
- **Framework chosen**: Streamlit for rapid development and deployment 
- **API Strategy**: Leverage existing sentiment_analyzer endpoints instead of direct DB access 
- **Real-time**: Use Streamlit auto-refresh and polling instead of WebSockets initially 
- **Caching**: Use Streamlit's @st.cache_data for API response caching (to implement in Phase 2)
- **Deployment**: Much simpler with Streamlit - just need Python environment 

###  Success Metrics Tracking
- Dashboard load time: Target < 2 seconds (to test in Phase 2)
- Real-time update latency: Target < 5 seconds (via polling) (to test in Phase 2)
- Concurrent user support: Target 100+ users (to test in Phase 4)
- Uptime availability: Target 99.9% (to test in Phase 5)

###  Review Schedule
- Weekly progress reviews
- Bi-weekly stakeholder updates
- End-of-phase milestone reviews
- Continuous user feedback collection
