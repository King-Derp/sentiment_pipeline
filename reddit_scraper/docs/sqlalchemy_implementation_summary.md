# SQLAlchemy ORM and Connection Pooling Implementation

## Overview

We've enhanced the Reddit scraper's PostgreSQL integration by implementing:

1. **SQLAlchemy ORM** for database interactions
2. **Connection Pooling** via PgBouncer (port 6432)

These changes align with the recommendations in the `postgres_readme.md` file and improve performance and maintainability. The implementation has been successfully tested and is now fully operational.

## Changes Made

### 1. New SQLAlchemy Database Module

Created `reddit_scraper/storage/database.py` with:
- SQLAlchemy ORM models matching the existing schema
- Connection pooling configuration
- Database initialization and verification functions

### 2. New SQLAlchemy-based PostgreSQL Sink

Created `reddit_scraper/storage/sqlalchemy_postgres_sink.py` with:
- Batch processing (100 records per batch)
- Efficient query handling with pagination
- Proper error handling and transaction management

### 3. Updated Composite Sink

Modified `reddit_scraper/storage/composite_sink.py` to:
- Support both legacy and SQLAlchemy-based PostgreSQL sinks
- Use environment variable `USE_SQLALCHEMY` to control which implementation to use
- Default to the new SQLAlchemy implementation

### 4. Updated CLI Script

Modified `reddit_scraper/cli.py` to:
- Use `CompositeSink` instead of `CsvSink` directly
- Properly respect the `USE_POSTGRES` environment variable
- Enable both CSV and PostgreSQL storage when running through the CLI

### 5. Docker Compose Configuration

Updated `docker-compose.yml` to:
- Use PgBouncer port (6432) instead of direct PostgreSQL (5432)
- Add `USE_SQLALCHEMY=true` environment variable
- Connect to the `market_pgbouncer` service on the `market_backend` network

## How to Test

1. Ensure the `market_pgbouncer` service is running on the `market_backend` network
2. Deploy the updated scraper:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
3. Check the logs to verify successful connection:
   ```
   docker-compose logs -f
   ```
4. Verify that new records are being inserted into PostgreSQL by checking the logs for messages like:
   ```
   POSTGRES SUCCESS: Inserted X records into PostgreSQL
   ```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Performance**:
   - Connection pooling reduces connection overhead
   - Batch processing improves insertion performance

2. **Better Code Organization**:
   - ORM models provide a clean abstraction of the database schema
   - Separation of concerns between database access and business logic

3. **Enhanced Maintainability**:
   - SQLAlchemy provides type safety and query building
   - Easier to extend with new features

4. **Compatibility**:
   - Works with the existing market_postgres schema
   - No schema changes required

## Current Status

The SQLAlchemy ORM and PgBouncer integration is now fully operational. The system has been tested and verified to:

1. Successfully connect to PgBouncer on port 6432
2. Insert new records into PostgreSQL through the CompositeSink
3. Properly handle both CSV and PostgreSQL storage

## Next Steps

1. Continue monitoring performance to ensure the connection pooling is working as expected
2. Consider implementing SQLAlchemy migrations for future schema changes
3. Add more comprehensive testing for the SQLAlchemy integration
4. Explore adding indexes to improve query performance for frequently accessed fields
