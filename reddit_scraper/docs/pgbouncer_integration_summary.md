# PgBouncer Integration with SQLAlchemy Summary

## Current Status

We have successfully integrated PgBouncer with SQLAlchemy for the Reddit scraper. The key findings are:

1. **Connection Established**: The Reddit scraper container can successfully connect to the PgBouncer service through the `market_backend` network.

2. **Database Access**: We can successfully query the PostgreSQL database through PgBouncer using SQLAlchemy ORM.

3. **Record Insertion**: We've verified that we can insert new records into the PostgreSQL database through PgBouncer using SQLAlchemy ORM.

4. **Existing Records**: The database currently contains 1824 total records, with 348 Reddit records. The most recent Reddit record was inserted during our testing at 16:03:21 on May 15, 2025.

## Configuration Details

The following configuration changes were made to connect to PgBouncer:

1. **Docker Compose Configuration**:
   - Updated `docker-compose.yml` to connect to the `market_backend` network
   - Set the PgBouncer host to `market_pgbouncer` and port to `6432`

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - `PG_HOST=market_pgbouncer`
   - `PG_PORT=6432`
   - `PG_DB=marketdb`
   - `PG_USER=market_user`
   - `PG_PASSWORD=${PG_PASSWORD}` (from .env file)
   - `USE_POSTGRES=true`
   - `USE_SQLALCHEMY=true`

## Observations

1. The Reddit scraper is actively collecting new submissions from subreddits like r/stocks and r/investing (as seen in the logs).

2. However, these new submissions are not being inserted into the PostgreSQL database through PgBouncer.

3. Our test script confirmed that we can manually insert records into the database through PgBouncer using SQLAlchemy ORM.

## Possible Issues

1. **Duplicate Detection**: The Reddit scraper might be skipping records that it has already seen. This is expected behavior to avoid duplicate entries.

2. **SQLAlchemy Sink Configuration**: The SQLAlchemy PostgreSQL sink might not be properly configured in the composite sink.

3. **Record Processing**: There might be an issue with how the records are being processed before insertion.

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Composite Sink**: Check if the SQLAlchemy PostgreSQL sink is properly configured in the composite sink and being used by the Reddit scraper.

2. **Force New Record Collection**: Modify the Reddit scraper to collect from a subreddit that hasn't been scraped before to ensure new records are found.

3. **Debug SQLAlchemy Sink**: Add more detailed logging to the SQLAlchemy PostgreSQL sink to understand if it's being called and if there are any issues with record insertion.

4. **Check Record Processing**: Verify that the records collected by the Reddit scraper are being properly processed before insertion.

## Conclusion

The PgBouncer integration with SQLAlchemy is working correctly from a technical standpoint. We can successfully connect to the database, query records, and insert new records. The issue now is understanding why the Reddit scraper isn't inserting new records into the database, which requires further investigation into the scraper's behavior and configuration.
