# Project Tasks

This document outlines the major tasks for the sentiment analysis pipeline project, organized by completion status.

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Scraper & Data Ingestion Setup

-   [x] **Setup Initial Project Structure:** Established the initial repository with `poetry` and a basic directory structure.
-   [x] **Implement Reddit Scraper:** Developed the core scraping logic using `asyncpraw` to fetch data from Reddit.
-   [x] **Define Data Models:** Created `RawEventDTO` (Pydantic) for data transfer and `RawEventORM` (SQLAlchemy) for database mapping.
-   [x] **Integrate TimescaleDB:** Set up TimescaleDB as the primary data store and configured it as a Docker service.
-   [x] **Implement Alembic Migrations:** Established schema management with Alembic to create the `raw_events` hypertable and other necessary database objects.
-   [x] **Develop Data Ingestion Sink:** Created the `SQLAlchemyPostgresSink` to handle idempotent bulk insertion of raw events into TimescaleDB.

### Phase 2: Sentiment Analysis Service - Core Logic

-   [x] **Create Service Structure:** Set up the `sentiment_analyzer` service directory and initial FastAPI application.
-   [x] **Define Sentiment ORM Models:** Created `SentimentResultORM` and `SentimentMetricORM` for storing analysis outputs.
-   [x] **Add Alembic Migrations for Sentiment Tables:** Wrote and applied migrations to create the `sentiment_results`, `sentiment_metrics`, and `dead_letter_events` hypertables.
-   [x] **Implement Data Fetcher:** Developed the `DataFetcher` class to efficiently query and claim unprocessed events from the `raw_events` table.
-   [x] **Integrate ML Model:** Integrated the Hugging Face Transformers library and a pre-trained sentiment analysis model.
-   [x] **Implement Result Processor:** Created the `ResultProcessor` to save successful analysis results, calculate aggregate metrics, and handle processing failures.
-   [x] **Develop Background Worker:** Implemented the main background task that orchestrates the fetch-analyze-store loop.

### Phase 3: API & Endpoint Development

-   [x] **Develop Health Check Endpoint:** Created a `/health` endpoint to monitor service status.
-   [x] **Implement Sentiment Result Endpoints:** Built API endpoints to query individual sentiment results with filtering and cursor-based pagination.
-   [x] **Implement Sentiment Metrics Endpoints:** Built API endpoints to query aggregated sentiment metrics with filtering and pagination.
-   [x] **Create Bulk Analysis Endpoint:** Added an endpoint to perform sentiment analysis on ad-hoc text provided in a request.
-   [x] **Integrate Power BI Streaming:** Implemented the necessary logic and endpoints to support real-time data streaming to Power BI.

### Phase 4: Production Readiness & Testing

-   [x] **Containerize Services:** Wrote Dockerfiles for all services (`reddit_scraper`, `sentiment_analyzer`).
-   [x] **Configure Docker Compose:** Created a `docker-compose.yml` for orchestrating the entire application stack.
-   [x] **Standardize Environment Configuration:** Ensured all configuration is handled via environment variables with sensible defaults.
-   [x] **Implement Comprehensive Logging:** Set up structured logging across all services.
-   [x] **Add Unit & Integration Tests:** Wrote a suite of tests using Pytest to cover core logic, database interactions, and API endpoints. Fixed all failing tests.
-   [x] **Implement Security Best Practices:** Added CORS middleware, rate limiting, and ensured the container runs with a non-root user.

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Task

-   **[ ] Final Documentation Review and Cleanup**
    -   **Goal:** Ensure all project documentation is accurate, consistent, and up-to-date with the final state of the codebase.
    -   **Tasks:**
        -   [x] Update `ARCHITECTURE.md` with the correct, detailed database schemas and system design.
        -   [x] Restore the comprehensive index in `DOCUMENTATION.md`.
        -   [x] Restore the detailed task history in `TASK.md`.
        -   [ ] Review and align all other documents (`README.md`, `sentiment_docs/*`, etc.) for consistency.

## ðŸ“š Backlog / Future Work

-   **Refine GPU Support:** Further optimize and document the process for using GPU acceleration for the analysis model.
-   **Advanced Monitoring:** Integrate Prometheus and Grafana for more detailed service monitoring and alerting.
-   **Expand Scraper Capabilities:** Add support for other data sources (e.g., Twitter, news APIs).
-   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Implement a full CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
